Reinforcement learning in games (Wumpus World environment)

From the professor:

Project topic 5. Reinforcement Learning agent in Wumpus world

a)Implement and integrate any chosen reinforcement learning method to control your agent in the Wumpus worldwith noisy action model(you may assume and implement whatever noisy action model that is reasonable). This turns your logicagent into a learning agent.

b)To complete this project, the prerequisiteis that you know the basics of reinforcement learning[Textbook Chapter 21]. Try varying the noisy action model to generate different behaviors. Compare the performance of your hybrid logic agent with reinforcement reasoning agent, under a noisy action model(with the logic agent assumes that there is no noise in the action model). You must provide statistical analyses for your results. You must also provide an analysis of convergence for your learning agent(i.e., how fast it converges to the optimal policy).

c)Submit a written report with your findings, which should include: 0. Abstract; 1. Introduction (motivation and your achievements in this project); 2) Technical approach (a brief technical discussion of how you formulate the problem into a reinforcement learning problem); 3) Results (Results that CLEARLY support your conclusions in a statistically meaningful way.). 4) Conclusions (any observations and discussions); 5) Team effectiveness (notes about team member contributions).

d)Submit your code with comments, and withinstructions(as a README file) to run it.
